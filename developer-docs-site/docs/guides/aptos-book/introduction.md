# Introduction

This book walks you through all you need to know to be an effective developer on Aptos through the development of a completely on-chain game called *Fight the Baddies*.

To get you started on your Aptos journey, we will teach you the basics of building a new application including use of Aptos tools as well as the various features of Move that will enable you to build robust applications that employ the state of the art paradigms found on the Aptos blockchain. We begin first by quickly, perhaps abruptly, onboarding you into Aptos. Afterward we began teaching Move starting with basic constructs like operations and data structures. Leveraging those components, we explain how the Move storage models work on Aptos with emphasis on the object model. In most cases, object assets benefit to conform to some standard model of ownership that can leverage common frameworks for that we introduce Aptosâ€™ tokens and fungible assets. Finally we connect all the pieces together demonstrating how to build a rich on-chain application that teaches more advanced constructs such as randomness.

Because both Move and the Aptos extensions around Move are ever evolving, the book focuses on the current preferred programming paradigms and leaves to the appendices other concepts that may be historical relics or exploratory in nature.
