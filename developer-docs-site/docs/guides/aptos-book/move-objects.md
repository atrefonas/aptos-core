# Move Objects

The previous section introduced global storage and two mechanisms for placing structs into storage: `key` and `store`. While both approaches work and are intuitive, they leave a lot of components up to the developer to implement. Aptos introduces Move Objects to extend upon the basics of the Move model and offer a framework for creating and managing a globally accessible set of heterogeneous resources that expedites and improves the developer experience.

Why objects? Well minimally an object gets you access to many features including:

- A common framework that defines ownership of an asset. No need to have one-off asset management as was demonstrated for hero in the previous chapter, nor come up with mechanisms to differentiate between similar yet different assets, e.g.., those that share the same common name.
- Global addressability of all objects that only requires virtual or referenced nesting of assets. Weapons were only accessible if you knew which hero had them and further nesting of assets make it much more complex to manage both in terms of code and data model.
- Events or metadata that make it easier to reason about changes to the object. An area not yet touched upon, Move Objects not only represent an asset but can express events as actions are taken involving the objects, making it easier for off-chain understanding of complex on-chain interactions.
- A permission framework that makes data convenient and safe to use. Limiting the possibility that gaining access to a `signer`s could be abused to manipulate or affect data.

Weâ€™ll go into each one of these in greater depth and further emphasize the utility of Objects over resources alone.

## Characters as Objects

For the most part, swapping from resources to objects is largely a set of API changes, but doing so unlocks a lot of opportunities.

```rust
/// Path: fight_the_baddies/sources/character.move

/// There was no character found at the specified address.

### Object Identifiers

As Objects are accumulation of resources at an address, each object is effectively represented by an address. The syntax for representing Objects in Move is `Object<T>`, where the `T` denotes a resource within the Object. The only contents of `Object<T>` is the address where the Object is stored. The terms object id and address are typically used interchangeably, but as an address can point to data other than objects, the preferred terminology is object id or object identifier.

### Creating Objects

Objects can be created in a handful of ways:
* The context of a transaction, namely, the sender's state via a call to `object::create_object_from_account`
* From an existing object, `object::create_object_from_object`

Both of these will generate a randon object id that requires reading the output of a transaction to know the generated object id.

Objects can also be generated with a deterministic address via `object::create_named_object`.

### Resource Groups
